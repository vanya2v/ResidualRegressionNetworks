# ResidualRegressionNetworks
Residual Regression Networks with denoising component for deep-learning based model fitting

Traditional quantitative MRI (qMRI) signal model ﬁtting to diffusion-weighted MRI (DW-MRI) is slow and requires long computational time per patient. In this work, we
explore q-space learning for prostate cancer characterization. Our results show that deep residual regression networks are needed for more complex diffusion MRI models such as VERDICT with compensated relaxation.
