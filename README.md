# Residual Regression Networks
Residual Regression Networks with denoising component for deep-learning based model fitting

Traditional quantitative MRI (qMRI) signal model Ô¨Åtting to diffusion-weighted MRI (DW-MRI) is slow and requires long computational time per patient. In this work, we
explore q-space learning for prostate cancer characterization. Our results show that deep residual regression networks are needed for more complex diffusion MRI models such as VERDICT with compensated relaxation.

This repository provides the codes for Model 3: stacked residual regression network with soft thresholding, as it is show to work effectively to remove noise-related features in MRI signals. Soft threshold can be learned in the dense block unit,  before addition with residual connection, as shown in this Figure.

### How to Use

1. Setup a virtual environment with these dependencies:
```keras with tensorflow backend
   scipy
   pandas
```

2. Start playing
```
train_resreg.py
```

3. Data you may need:

a. For training
Synthetic training data (in-silico) q-space learning -  generated from equations derived from a diffusion model. For our model, it is from VERDICT (please refer to another repository on how to generate this).
If you don't have it, you can use the one under ```training_data\```
 
b. For model prediction:
Patient data for model prediction (pre-processed and registered). Predict the parameters from trained networks from DW-MRI scans (depends on protocols).
Please refer to another repository on how to obtain this format from raw DW-MRI data.
